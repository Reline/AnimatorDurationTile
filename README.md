# Animator Duration Quick Settings Tile

A quick settings tile to quickly toggle the animator duration scale:

1. Pressing the tile toggles between 5x & 1x duration scales.
2. Long pressing the tile allows selecting from the full choice of scales.

Note that this app requires you to **manually grant permission** to allow the app to alter the animator duration setting. To do this, issue the following `adb` command:

`adb shell pm grant uk.co.nickbutcher.animatordurationtile android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS`

I have included a script to perform the build, installation, and permission grant process for you.

In the home directory:
```
./deploy.sh -r
```

or if the apk has already been built, just run

```
./deploy.sh
```

This app also only runs on Nougat+ devices.
